        During My Time at Bright Power some of my Responsibilities including Writing unit testing for Spring MVC application for REST controllers using JUnit, Mockito. I also Created test suite for newly created API services using postman to examine performance. I Conducted other QA responsibilities such as regression/feature testing in order to identify Defects in pre-released software. One project I worked on creating and maintaining a data scraping tool using selenium and beautifulsoup for internal use.
